<h3>Time spent in activities</h3>

<p>This time calculation considers all use time spent in course activities, letting course 
	layout times out of calculation. In certain cases (when using the (reworked) Checklist with
	standard time allocation (http://github.com/vfremaux/moodle-mod_checklist.git), additional 
	standard time are used rather than real extracted times from log.</p>
