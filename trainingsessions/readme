The Course Training Session report provides a structured reporting of elapsed time
by the usrs within a Moodle course, and presenting those detailed result conformely
to the course most probable pedagogic layout. 

The pedagogic organisation is compiled from the internal course setup information and
will be aware of most course formats in Moodle. At least are handled : 

- Topic course format
- Weekly course format

as standard

- Flexipage course format (and all variants called "page")

In the former cases will the course structure be derivated from section list, getting the
propoer order of activities and resources as setup by the editing teacher.

In the latter case will the course structure be derivated from a recursive analysis of the 
flexipage construction, starting from first page. The recursion will essentially count on 
a pagemenu module that should provide the entire explorable structure of the course. In its 
standard implementation only published pages (that is visible by students) will be processed.
